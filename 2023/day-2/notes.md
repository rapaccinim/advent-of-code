# Notes - Day 2 - Cube Conundrum
## Part 1
I think that the code could be improved.

ATM I've reached an acceptable solution where the different methods are explicitly defined.

I've also assumed that the game index (e.g. `Game 26`) is following the 1-100 correct order.
This allowed me to ignore the value of the game index.
Instead, I've just been using `index` + 1 of each input line.

## Part 2
TBD
