# Notes - Day 2 - Cube Conundrum
## Part 1
I think that the code could be improved.

ATM I've reached an acceptable solution where the different methods are explicitly defined.

I've also assumed that the game index (e.g. `Game 26`) is following the 1-100 correct order.
This allowed me to ignore the value of the game index.
Instead, I've just been using `index` + 1 of each input line.

## Part 2
Don't know why it took me a lot of time to understand the assignment... Maybe because it's Saturday evening!

The assignment itself it's easier than what it looks (saying this after reading it for the 7th time...).

By solving the second part I've understood that the code in the first one can be improved a lot!
